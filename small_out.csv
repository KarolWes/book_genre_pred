0,Drowned Wednesday,fantasy," Drowned Wednesday is the first Trustee among the Morrow Days who is on Arthur's side and wishes the Will to be fulfilled. She appears as a leviathan/whale and suffers from Gluttony. The book begins when Leaf is visiting Arthur and they are discussing the invitation that Drowned Wednesday sent him. Arthur had been admitted to hospital because of the damage done to his leg when he attempted to enter Tuesday's Treasure Tower. Suddenly, the hospital room becomes flooded with water as the two are transported to the Border Sea of the House. Leaf is snatched away by a large ship with green sails, known as the Flying Mantis, while Arthur remains in his bed. When the Medallion given him by the immortal called the Mariner apparently fails to summon help, Arthur is without hope. Eventually, a buoy marking the pirate Elishar Feverfew's treasure floats toward him. As soon as Arthur opens it, his hand is marked with a bloody red colour. Arthur now has the Red Hand, by which Feverfew marks whoever has found his treasure, so that he can identify them later. Not long after, a scavenging ship called the Moth rescues Arthur. On board, Arthur (going by the name of Arth) is introduced to Sunscorch, the First Mate, and to Captain Catapillow. Their journey brings them through the Line of Storms and into the Border Sea, where they are later pursued by Feverfew's ghostly ship, the Shiver. The damage inflicted on the Moth is serious; therefore Sunscorch commands an Upper House Sorcerer, Dr. Scamandros, to open a transfer portal to elsewhere in the Secondary Realms. Scamandros claims that Arthur is carrying something that interfered with his magic, and tells Sunscorch to throw him overboard. As a last resort, Arthur shows them the Mariner's Medallion, which stops Scamandros saying that they must get rid of Arthur. After going through the transfer portal (with Arthur's help), the ship is grounded on a beach. When Arthur wished to learn what happened to Leaf, Dr. Scamandros applies his sorcery to make it possible. She is revealed to be aboard the ship Flying Mantis. Arthur joins Catapillow for supper, later to reveal his identity. At first, Propaganda issued by Dame Primus (Arthur's Steward) makes them skeptical of this, but they eventually become convinced. A few days later, Wednesday's Dawn takes Arthur to meet Wednesday for her 'luncheon of seventeen removes'. As they approach, Wednesday shrinks into her human form to meet Arthur. During their lunch, Wednesday tells Arthur that after Part 3 of the Will has been released, she will surrender the Third Key to Arthur. Arthur is then taken by Wednesday's Dawn to a place called the triangle in search of his friend Leaf. He learns that Leaf has been forced to work on the Mantis, but is otherwise intact. Arthur later makes a deal with the Raised Rats, a group of anthropomorphic rats brought to the House by the Piper, to take him to Feverfew's hideout, which they believe is inside a miniature world located within Drowned Wednesday's stomach. On the Raised Rats' ship, Arthur opens a gift from Dr. Scamandros, which proves to be a golden transfer watch. With this, he communicates with and rescues Dr. Scamandros. He then uses a scrying mirror Dr. Scamandros gave him to watch Leaf. A rat watches him during the scry, and later saves him from a battle with Feverfew. Later, the Rats bring Arthur onto their submarine, where he meets with Suzy Turquiose Blue. In contrast to Suzy's former cockney attitude, she has assumed a more ""ladylike and proper"" demeanor on the orders of Dame Primus. Only when they are no longer on the Border Sea, but under it, does she resume her customary ways of speech and dress. They are, with navigational difficulty, able to enter the stomach of Lady Wednesday and the worldlet therein. There, Arthur and Suzy, disguised as rats, find escaped slaves, professed followers of the Carp. These exiles take them to the Carp, who is the third part of the Will. They are halted in their attempt to escape by Feverfew, who proposes that each of them will try to kill the other by means of one strike only. Arthur fails his first try, then dodges Feverfew and severs his head. Leaf, who is Feverfew's prisoner, then kicks it into a mud puddle containing Nothing, which consumes it. Upon his death, the worldlet begins to collapse. Via the Moth, Arthur and all his friends (with the exception of the reluctant Catapillow) are able to escape. Lady Wednesday recovers from her gluttony, then dies as a result of being poisoned by the worldlet, which had opened a void to Nothing. Arthur, now Duke of the Border Sea, appoints Sunscorch as his Noon and Scamandros as his Dusk. fr:Mercredi sous les flots th:พุธเพชฌฆาต","['drown', 'wednesday', 'first', 'trustee', 'among', 'morrow', 'day', 'arthur', 'side', 'wish', 'fulfil', 'appear', 'suffer', 'gluttony', 'book', 'begin', 'leaf', 'visit', 'arthur', 'discuss', 'invitation', 'drown', 'wednesday', 'send', 'arthur', 'admit', 'hospital', 'damage', 'do', 'leg', 'attempt', 'enter', 'tuesday', 'treasure', 'tower', 'suddenly', 'hospital', 'room', 'become', 'flood', 'water', 'two', 'transport', 'border', 'sea', 'house', 'leaf', 'snatch', 'away', 'large', 'ship', 'green', 'sail', 'know', 'fly', 'mantis', 'arthur', 'remain', 'bed', 'medallion', 'give', 'immortal', 'call', 'mariner', 'apparently', 'fail', 'summon', 'help', 'arthur', 'without', 'hope', 'eventually', 'buoy', 'mark', 'pirate', 'elishar', 'feverfew', 'treasure', 'float', 'toward', 'soon', 'arthur', 'open', 'hand', 'mark', 'bloody', 'red', 'colour', 'arthur', 'red', 'hand', 'feverfew', 'mark', 'whoever', 'find', 'treasure', 'identify', 'later', 'long', 'scavenge', 'ship', 'call', 'moth', 'rescue', 'arthur', 'board', 'arthur', 'go', 'name', 'arth', 'introduce', 'sunscorch', 'first', 'mate', 'captain', 'catapillow', 'journey', 'bring', 'line', 'storm', 'border', 'sea', 'later', 'pursue', 'feverfew', 'ghostly', 'ship', 'shiver', 'damage', 'inflict', 'moth', 'serious', 'therefore', 'sunscorch', 'command', 'upper', 'house', 'sorcerer', 'scamandros', 'open', 'transfer', 'portal', 'elsewhere', 'secondary', 'realm', 'scamandros', 'claim', 'arthur', 'carry', 'something', 'interfere', 'magic', 'tell', 'sunscorch', 'throw', 'overboard', 'last', 'resort', 'arthur', 'show', 'mariner', 'medallion', 'stop', 'scamandros', 'say', 'must', 'get', 'rid', 'arthur', 'go', 'transfer', 'portal', 'arthur', 'help', 'ship', 'ground', 'beach', 'arthur', 'wish', 'learn', 'happen', 'leaf', 'scamandros', 'apply', 'sorcery', 'make', 'possible', 'reveal', 'aboard', 'ship', 'fly', 'mantis', 'arthur', 'join', 'catapillow', 'supper', 'later', 'reveal', 'identity', 'first', 'propaganda', 'issue', 'dame', 'primus', 'arthur', 'steward', 'make', 'skeptical', 'eventually', 'become', 'convince', 'day', 'later', 'wednesday', 'dawn', 'take', 'arthur', 'meet', 'wednesday', 'seventeen', 'remove', 'approach', 'wednesday', 'shrink', 'human', 'form', 'meet', 'arthur', 'lunch', 'wednesday', 'tell', 'arthur', 'part', 'release', 'surrender', 'third', 'key', 'arthur', 'arthur', 'take', 'wednesday', 'dawn', 'place', 'call', 'triangle', 'search', 'friend', 'leaf', 'learn', 'leaf', 'force', 'work', 'mantis', 'otherwise', 'intact', 'arthur', 'later', 'make', 'deal', 'raise', 'rat', 'group', 'anthropomorphic', 'rat', 'bring', 'house', 'piper', 'take', 'feverfew', 'hideout', 'believe', 'inside', 'miniature', 'world', 'locate', 'within', 'drown', 'wednesday', 'stomach', 'raise', 'rat', 'ship', 'arthur', 'open', 'gift', 'scamandros', 'prof', 'golden', 'transfer', 'watch', 'communicate', 'rescue', 'scamandros', 'us', 'scry', 'mirror', 'scamandros', 'give', 'watch', 'leaf', 'rat', 'watch', 'scry', 'later', 'save', 'battle', 'feverfew', 'later', 'rat', 'bring', 'arthur', 'onto', 'submarine', 'meet', 'suzy', 'turquiose', 'blue', 'contrast', 'suzy', 'former', 'cockney', 'attitude', 'assume', 'ladylike', 'proper', 'demeanor', 'order', 'dame', 'primus', 'longer', 'border', 'sea', 'resume', 'customary', 'way', 'speech', 'dress', 'navigational', 'difficulty', 'able', 'enter', 'stomach', 'lady', 'wednesday', 'worldlet', 'therein', 'arthur', 'suzy', 'disguise', 'rat', 'find', 'escape', 'slave', 'profess', 'follower', 'carp', 'exile', 'take', 'carp', 'third', 'part', 'halt', 'attempt', 'escape', 'feverfew', 'propose', 'try', 'kill', 'mean', 'one', 'strike', 'arthur', 'fail', 'first', 'try', 'dodge', 'feverfew', 'sever', 'head', 'leaf', 'feverfew', 'prisoner', 'kick', 'mud', 'puddle', 'contain', 'nothing', 'consume', 'upon', 'death', 'worldlet', 'begin', 'collapse', 'via', 'moth', 'arthur', 'friend', 'exception', 'reluctant', 'catapillow', 'able', 'escape', 'lady', 'wednesday', 'recover', 'gluttony', 'dy', 'result', 'poison', 'worldlet', 'open', 'void', 'nothing', 'arthur', 'duke', 'border', 'sea', 'appoint', 'sunscorch', 'noon', 'scamandros', 'dusk', 'fr', 'mercredi', 'sou', 'le', 'flots', 'th']"
1,The Lost Hero,fantasy," As the book opens, Jason awakens on a school bus, unable to remember who or where he is, or anything about his past. He is sitting next to Piper McLean and Leo Valdez, who call him by name and say they are his girlfriend and best friend respectively. All three are part of a class field trip to the Grand Canyon, and after they arrive, a classmate Dylan turns into a Venti (Storm Spirit) and attacks the trio and their trip leader, Coach Gleeson Hedge. In the ensuing fight, Jason surprises everyone, including himself, when one of his coins turns into a sword which he uses to battle the storm spirits. Coach Hedge, who reveals himself to be a satyr during the fight, is taken captive by a fleeing spirit. After the battle, a flying chariot arrives to rescue the trio, but one of the people in it, Annabeth, is upset when she discovers that her missing boyfriend, Percy Jackson, is not there as she expected. Annabeth, seeking Percy, was told in a vision from the goddess Hera to look there for the ""guy with one shoe"", but this turns out to be Jason, who had a shoe destroyed during the fight. Jason, Piper,and Leo are told that they are demigods and are taken back to Camp Half-Blood where they meet other greek demigod children like themselves. There, Leo is revealed as a son of Hephaestus, Piper as a daughter of Aphrodite and Jason as a son of Zeus, though Hera tells him he is her champion. Jason later discovers that he is the full brother of Zeus's demigod daughter Thalia Grace, who is a Hunter of Artemis. Shortly after they arrive, the three are given a quest to rescue Hera, who has been captured, and they set off. They soon discover that their enemies are working under orders from Gaea to overthrow the gods. During their quest, they encounter Thalia and the Hunters, who have been looking for Percy. Thalia and Jason reunite for the first since Jason was captured at the age of two. On the way to Aeolus's castle, Jason, Leo and Piper become separated from Thalia, who promises to meet them at the Wolf House, the last place Thalia had seen Jason before this meeting. After being nearly apprehended by Aeolus, who is under Gaea's orders, the trio manage to escape thanks to Mellie, Aeolus`s former assistant, and end up in San Francisco, thanks to the result of a dream Piper had with Aphrodite. After landing in San Francisco, the trio rush to Mt.Diablo to fight the giant Enceladus, who has kidnapped Piper's father. They manage to kill the giant and save Piper's father, after which they rush to the Wolf House to free Hera. Although the heroes and the Hunters save Hera, the king of the giants, Porphyrion, rises fully and disappears into a hole in the Earth. Jason's memory then starts returning, and he remembers that he is a hero from a Roman counterpart to Camp Half-Blood somewhere near San Francisco, and is the son of Jupiter, Zeus's Roman aspect. He realizes that Hera, also known as Juno, has switched him with Percy Jackson, who will be at the Roman camp with no memory of his life, in the hopes that the two camps would ultimately work together to fight the giants and defeat the goddess Gaea.","['book', 'open', 'jason', 'awaken', 'school', 'bus', 'unable', 'remember', 'anything', 'past', 'sit', 'next', 'piper', 'mclean', 'leo', 'valdez', 'call', 'name', 'say', 'girlfriend', 'best', 'friend', 'respectively', 'three', 'part', 'class', 'field', 'trip', 'grand', 'canyon', 'arrive', 'classmate', 'dylan', 'turn', 'venti', 'storm', 'spirit', 'attack', 'trio', 'trip', 'leader', 'coach', 'gleeson', 'hedge', 'ensue', 'fight', 'jason', 'surprise', 'everyone', 'include', 'one', 'coin', 'turn', 'sword', 'us', 'battle', 'storm', 'spirit', 'coach', 'hedge', 'reveal', 'satyr', 'fight', 'take', 'captive', 'flee', 'spirit', 'battle', 'fly', 'chariot', 'arrive', 'rescue', 'trio', 'one', 'people', 'annabeth', 'upset', 'discover', 'miss', 'boyfriend', 'percy', 'jackson', 'expect', 'annabeth', 'seek', 'percy', 'tell', 'vision', 'goddess', 'hera', 'look', 'guy', 'one', 'shoe', 'turn', 'jason', 'shoe', 'destroy', 'fight', 'jason', 'piper', 'leo', 'tell', 'demigod', 'take', 'back', 'camp', 'meet', 'greek', 'demigod', 'child', 'like', 'leo', 'reveal', 'son', 'hephaestus', 'piper', 'daughter', 'aphrodite', 'jason', 'son', 'zeus', 'though', 'hera', 'tell', 'champion', 'jason', 'later', 'discover', 'full', 'brother', 'zeus', 'demigod', 'daughter', 'thalia', 'grace', 'hunter', 'artemis', 'shortly', 'arrive', 'three', 'give', 'quest', 'rescue', 'hera', 'capture', 'set', 'soon', 'discover', 'enemy', 'work', 'order', 'gaea', 'overthrow', 'god', 'quest', 'encounter', 'thalia', 'hunter', 'look', 'percy', 'thalia', 'jason', 'reunite', 'first', 'since', 'jason', 'capture', 'age', 'two', 'way', 'aeolus', 'castle', 'jason', 'leo', 'piper', 'become', 'separate', 'thalia', 'promise', 'meet', 'wolf', 'house', 'last', 'place', 'thalia', 'see', 'jason', 'meet', 'nearly', 'apprehend', 'aeolus', 'gaea', 'order', 'trio', 'manage', 'escape', 'thank', 'mellie', 'aeolus', 'former', 'assistant', 'end', 'san', 'francisco', 'thank', 'result', 'dream', 'piper', 'aphrodite', 'land', 'san', 'francisco', 'trio', 'rush', 'fight', 'giant', 'enceladus', 'kidnap', 'piper', 'father', 'manage', 'kill', 'giant', 'save', 'piper', 'father', 'rush', 'wolf', 'house', 'free', 'hera', 'although', 'hero', 'hunter', 'save', 'hera', 'king', 'giant', 'porphyrion', 'rise', 'fully', 'disappear', 'hole', 'earth', 'jason', 'memory', 'start', 'return', 'remember', 'hero', 'roman', 'counterpart', 'camp', 'somewhere', 'near', 'san', 'francisco', 'son', 'jupiter', 'zeus', 'roman', 'aspect', 'realize', 'hera', 'also', 'know', 'juno', 'switch', 'percy', 'jackson', 'roman', 'camp', 'memory', 'life', 'hope', 'two', 'camp', 'would', 'ultimately', 'work', 'together', 'fight', 'giant', 'defeat', 'goddess', 'gaea']"
2,The Eyes of the Overworld,fantasy," Cugel is easily persuaded by the merchant Fianosther to attempt the burglary of the manse of Iucounu the Laughing Magician. Trapped and caught, he agrees that in exchange for his freedom he will undertake the recovery of a small hemisphere of violet glass, an Eye of the Overworld, to match one already in the wizard's possession. A small sentient alien entity of barbs and hooks, named Firx, is attached to his liver to encourage his ""unremitting loyalty, zeal and singleness of purpose,"" and Iucounu uses a spell to transport Cugel via flying demon to the remote Land of Cutz. There, Cugel finds two villages, one occupied by wearers of the violet lenses, the other by peasants who work on behalf of the lens-wearers, in hopes of being promoted to their ranks. The lenses cause their wearers to see, not their squalid surroundings, but the Overworld, a vastly superior version of reality where a hut is a palace, gruel is a magnificent feast, etc. — ""seeing the world through rose-colored glasses"" on a grand scale. Cugel gains an Eye by trickery, and escapes from Cutz. He then undertakes an arduous trek back to Iucounu, cursing the magician the entire way; this forms the principal part of the book. After many pitfalls, setbacks, and harrowing escapes, including the eviction of Firx from his system, Cugel returns to Iucounu's manse, where he finds the wizard's volition has been captured by a twin to Firx. Cugel manages to extirpate the alien, subdue the magician, and enjoy the easy life in the manse, until he tries to banish Iucounu and Fianosther (who himself has come to pilfer from Cugel) with the same spell that the magician had used on him. But Cugel's tongue slips in uttering the incantation, and the flying demon seizes him instead, delivering him to the same spot as before. Author Michael Shea wrote an authorized sequel, A Quest for Simbilis (DAW Books, NY, 1974). Vance's own Cugel sequel was published as Cugel's Saga in 1983.","['cugel', 'easily', 'persuade', 'merchant', 'fianosther', 'attempt', 'burglary', 'manse', 'iucounu', 'laugh', 'magician', 'trap', 'catch', 'agree', 'exchange', 'freedom', 'undertake', 'recovery', 'small', 'hemisphere', 'violet', 'glass', 'eye', 'overworld', 'match', 'one', 'already', 'wizard', 'possession', 'small', 'sentient', 'alien', 'entity', 'barb', 'hook', 'name', 'firx', 'attach', 'liver', 'encourage', 'unremitting', 'loyalty', 'zeal', 'singleness', 'purpose', 'iucounu', 'us', 'spell', 'transport', 'cugel', 'via', 'fly', 'demon', 'remote', 'land', 'cutz', 'cugel', 'find', 'two', 'village', 'one', 'occupy', 'wearer', 'violet', 'lens', 'peasant', 'work', 'behalf', 'hope', 'promote', 'rank', 'lens', 'cause', 'wearer', 'see', 'squalid', 'surround', 'overworld', 'vastly', 'superior', 'version', 'reality', 'hut', 'palace', 'gruel', 'magnificent', 'feast', 'etc', 'see', 'world', 'glass', 'grand', 'scale', 'cugel', 'gain', 'eye', 'trickery', 'escape', 'cutz', 'undertake', 'arduous', 'trek', 'back', 'iucounu', 'curse', 'magician', 'entire', 'way', 'form', 'principal', 'part', 'book', 'many', 'pitfall', 'setback', 'harrow', 'escape', 'include', 'eviction', 'firx', 'system', 'cugel', 'return', 'iucounu', 'manse', 'find', 'wizard', 'volition', 'capture', 'twin', 'firx', 'cugel', 'manage', 'extirpate', 'alien', 'subdue', 'magician', 'enjoy', 'easy', 'life', 'manse', 'try', 'banish', 'iucounu', 'fianosther', 'come', 'pilfer', 'cugel', 'spell', 'magician', 'use', 'cugel', 'tongue', 'slip', 'utter', 'incantation', 'fly', 'demon', 'seize', 'instead', 'deliver', 'spot', 'author', 'michael', 'shea', 'write', 'authorize', 'sequel', 'quest', 'simbilis', 'daw', 'book', 'ny', 'vance', 'cugel', 'sequel', 'publish', 'cugel', 'saga']"
3,Magic's Promise,fantasy," The book opens with Herald-Mage Vanyel returning to his country Valdemar from an extensive campaign along the border with Karse, the neighboring enemy country. He checks in with Valdemar's King Randale and his lifebonded mate, Shavri, and their daughter Jisa. Only a select few know that Jisa is Vanyel's daughter. Because King Randale is sterile, he had asked Vanyel to father an heir. Now, Shavri confides in Vanyel her fear that Randale is mortally ill. Vanyel and his mentor Savil return to Vanyel's family home at Forst Reach, where they find little rest or peace. His parents both try to change his mind about being shay'a'chern, or homosexual. Vanyel becomes somewhat confused about his own sexuality. He wonders if he is truly in love with Shavri. Yfandes, Vanyel's Companion, doesn't buy it and finds the situation amusing. Vanyel also meets his illegitimate nephew, Medren. Medren is small for his age as Vanyel was, and like him it appears that he is often bullied by the armsmaster Jervis. The boy has a powerful Bardic gift, and Vanyel sponsors him for the Bardic Collegium. Vanyel confronts Jervis and learns that the armsmaster is not being intentionally rough. He also apologizes for beating Vanyel long ago, and explains his difficult position with Vanyel's father. He also mentions that he knew Vanyel was shay'a'chern from the beginning, but also knew from his army service that being gay does not keep men from being courageous warriors. Vanyel accepts this and they form an uneasy friendship. The main plot focuses on how Vanyel assists young Prince Tashir Remoerdis. Vanyel and Yandes receive a psychic summons into the neighboring country of Lineas. Upon arrival, they find Tashir, who has just become a Herald, with his Companion, Leshya (nicknamed Ghost by Yfandes). Another Herald, Lores, is beating the child and attacks Ghost when he tries to interfere. He believes that Tashir is actually an evil sorcerer who has murdered his own family. Vanyel immediately stops Lores and commands him to return to Valdemar. Vanyel takes Tashir back to his own home, Forst Reach, and begins to try and discover what truly happened to Tashir's family. He then returns to Lineas, disguised as a minstrel to gather information. In Lineas magic is taboo; no one is supposed to perform it for any reason. It shares a border with Baires, a country ruled by the Mavelan, a family of mages. A treaty was signed to end the warring between the two countries, sealed by the marriage of Tashir's parents. In the treaty there exists a clause that if the royal family of Lineas dies out, the Mavelan can take over the Lineas throne, and vice versa. Vanyel meets an old servant of the Remoerdis family who tells him of Tashir's sad childhood. Tashir was physically and emotionally abused by his father and sexually abused by his mother. His mother was mentally unstable and made seductive overtures to Tashir even as a young child. Tashir looks very much like his mother's uncle Vedric, and rumor has it that he is the product of an incestuous affair between them. Returning to Forst Reach, Vanyel recruits Savil and Jervis to help. Together with Tashir, they return to Lineas, breaking through the palace's magic shields to search the place. They find a secret room which contains a ""heart-stone"", an ordinary rock connected with a magical ""node"" which is keeping a deep, dangerous fault sealed. As the stone was unstable and any magic done in the area could disturb it, a guardian family without magic was appointed. If the stone were to be removed, a giant earthquake would occur destroying Lineas, parts of the outlands, and the border of Valdemar. That was why magic was anathema in Lineas, and also why everyone in the palace was blood related member of the Remoerdis family, sworn to protect the node. In the palace Vanyel and Savil discover a ""trap-spell"", which targets one person and also kills the target's entire family. Tashir's family were the victims of the trap-spell, which was placed by Tashir's uncle Vedric, whose intention is to control both Lineas and Baires. (He is not, however, Tashir's father.) Vedric tries the same trick on Vanyel, who has already caught on and sent Savil away, along with Tashir, while keeping Jervis with him. In defending himself, Vanyel ends up killing most of the Baires family as well as Vedric. Now king of both Baires and Lineas, Tashir considers himself too young and inexperienced. He allows King Randale to annex the two smaller countries into Valdemar. Vanyel finally sorts out that he actually is gay, and that Shavri is just a good friend.","['book', 'open', 'vanyel', 'return', 'country', 'valdemar', 'extensive', 'campaign', 'along', 'border', 'karse', 'neighbor', 'enemy', 'country', 'check', 'valdemar', 'king', 'randale', 'lifebonded', 'mate', 'shavri', 'daughter', 'jisa', 'select', 'know', 'jisa', 'vanyel', 'daughter', 'king', 'randale', 'sterile', 'ask', 'vanyel', 'father', 'heir', 'shavri', 'confide', 'vanyel', 'fear', 'randale', 'mortally', 'vanyel', 'mentor', 'savil', 'return', 'vanyel', 'family', 'home', 'forst', 'reach', 'find', 'little', 'rest', 'peace', 'parent', 'try', 'change', 'mind', 'shay', 'homosexual', 'vanyel', 'become', 'somewhat', 'confuse', 'sexuality', 'wonder', 'truly', 'love', 'shavri', 'yfandes', 'vanyel', 'companion', 'buy', 'find', 'situation', 'amuse', 'vanyel', 'also', 'meet', 'illegitimate', 'nephew', 'medren', 'medren', 'small', 'age', 'vanyel', 'like', 'appear', 'often', 'bully', 'armsmaster', 'jervis', 'boy', 'powerful', 'bardic', 'gift', 'vanyel', 'sponsor', 'bardic', 'collegium', 'vanyel', 'confront', 'jervis', 'learn', 'armsmaster', 'intentionally', 'rough', 'also', 'apologize', 'beat', 'vanyel', 'long', 'ago', 'explain', 'difficult', 'position', 'vanyel', 'father', 'also', 'mention', 'know', 'vanyel', 'shay', 'begin', 'also', 'know', 'army', 'service', 'gay', 'keep', 'men', 'courageous', 'warrior', 'vanyel', 'accept', 'form', 'uneasy', 'friendship', 'main', 'plot', 'focus', 'vanyel', 'assist', 'young', 'prince', 'tashir', 'remoerdis', 'vanyel', 'yandes', 'receive', 'psychic', 'summon', 'neighbor', 'country', 'lineas', 'upon', 'arrival', 'find', 'tashir', 'become', 'herald', 'companion', 'leshya', 'nickname', 'ghost', 'yfandes', 'another', 'herald', 'lore', 'beat', 'child', 'attack', 'ghost', 'try', 'interfere', 'belief', 'tashir', 'actually', 'evil', 'sorcerer', 'murder', 'family', 'vanyel', 'immediately', 'stop', 'lore', 'command', 'return', 'valdemar', 'vanyel', 'take', 'tashir', 'back', 'home', 'forst', 'reach', 'begin', 'try', 'discover', 'truly', 'happen', 'tashir', 'family', 'return', 'lineas', 'disguise', 'minstrel', 'gather', 'information', 'lineas', 'magic', 'taboo', 'one', 'suppose', 'perform', 'reason', 'share', 'border', 'baires', 'country', 'rule', 'mavelan', 'family', 'mages', 'treaty', 'sign', 'end', 'war', 'two', 'country', 'seal', 'marriage', 'tashir', 'parent', 'treaty', 'exist', 'clause', 'royal', 'family', 'lineas', 'dy', 'mavelan', 'take', 'lineas', 'throne', 'vice', 'versa', 'vanyel', 'meet', 'old', 'servant', 'remoerdis', 'family', 'tell', 'tashir', 'sad', 'childhood', 'tashir', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'abuse', 'father', 'sexually', 'abuse', 'mother', 'mother', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'make', 'seductive', 'overture', 'tashir', 'even', 'young', 'child', 'tashir', 'look', 'much', 'like', 'mother', 'uncle', 'vedric', 'rumor', 'product', 'incestuous', 'affair', 'return', 'forst', 'reach', 'vanyel', 'recruit', 'savil', 'jervis', 'help', 'together', 'tashir', 'return', 'lineas', 'break', 'palace', 'magic', 'shield', 'search', 'place', 'find', 'secret', 'room', 'contain', 'ordinary', 'rock', 'connect', 'magical', 'node', 'keep', 'deep', 'dangerous', 'fault', 'seal', 'stone', 'unstable', 'magic', 'do', 'area', 'could', 'disturb', 'guardian', 'family', 'without', 'magic', 'appoint', 'stone', 'remove', 'giant', 'earthquake', 'would', 'occur', 'destroy', 'lineas', 'part', 'outlands', 'border', 'valdemar', 'magic', 'anathema', 'lineas', 'also', 'everyone', 'palace', 'blood', 'relate', 'member', 'remoerdis', 'family', 'swear', 'protect', 'node', 'palace', 'vanyel', 'savil', 'discover', 'target', 'one', 'person', 'also', 'kill', 'target', 'entire', 'family', 'tashir', 'family', 'victim', 'place', 'tashir', 'uncle', 'vedric', 'whose', 'intention', 'control', 'lineas', 'baires', 'however', 'tashir', 'father', 'vedric', 'try', 'trick', 'vanyel', 'already', 'catch', 'send', 'savil', 'away', 'along', 'tashir', 'keep', 'jervis', 'defend', 'vanyel', 'end', 'kill', 'baires', 'family', 'well', 'vedric', 'king', 'baires', 'lineas', 'tashir', 'consider', 'young', 'inexperienced', 'allow', 'king', 'randale', 'annex', 'two', 'smaller', 'country', 'valdemar', 'vanyel', 'finally', 'sort', 'actually', 'gay', 'shavri', 'good', 'friend']"
4,Taran Wanderer,fantasy," Taran and Gurgi have returned to Caer Dallben following the events of the third chronicle, The Castle of Llyr. It is now full springtime, at least three years after The Book of Three. Taran knows that he loves Princess Eilonwy, who now resides at Dinas Rhydnant for royal education. In full springtime some weeks after return from escorting her there, he is restless and determines to know his parentage, noble or common, partly in hopes that noble birth will support a marriage proposal. Dallben the enchanter tells him nothing but gives his approval for Taran and Gurgi to travel on their own. They travel first to the Marshes of Morva to ask the witches Orddu, Orwen and Orgoch. Taran has nothing of great value to give in exchange, so Orddu merely tells him of an alternative, the Mirror of Llunet in the far east Llawgadarn Mountains will show him who he is. Taran goes next to Cantrev Cadiffor to be outfit by King Smoit for a longer journey. After a border patrol of Smoit's vassal Lord Goryon steals his horse Melynlas and Gurgi's pony, they spend the night with the farm couple Aeddan and Alarca who have lost their son and livestock. Taran would be welcome to remain and he leaves with new respect for common farmers. They recover their steeds because Melynlas will have no other rider and Goryon is relieved to escape the honorary burden of mastering him.At the neighboring stronghold of Lord Gast they meet old friend Fflewddur Fflam, who seems to return to wandering as a bard every spring. Together they go on to Caer Cadarn where Smoit does welcome them. Goryon and Gast have been feuding for years (every spring?), especially over the prize cow Cornillo. When their dispute breaks out again next day, Taran questions King Smoit's habitual resort to imprisonment and persuades Smoit to try Taran's judgment. Namely, the rival cantrev lords shall resow the fields of Aeddan, which have been ruined by battles. The prize cow shall be further compensation, although the lords shall have her calves. The remainder of their commingled herds shall be divided in half by Goryon, and Gast will choose which half to take for himself. The childless widower Smoit later offers to adopt Taran as his son, who will succeed as King of Cadiffor. Taran declines but says he will gladly accept if he discovers noble birth. Continuing eastward, they cross Ystrad. Taran's pet crow Kaw and Fflewddur's mount Llyan, a giant lion, find treasures which they bring to their masters. Kaw a polished bone the size of a toothpick, which has been stashed high in a tree. Llyan a green and yellow frog that has nearly dried to death: their old friend Doli the dwarf, whom they revive. Doli has been transformed during investigation of a deadly threat to the Fair Folk. He knows that he is not the first to disappear in animal form, for a human wizard Morda has attained power to enchant them, and to raid their underground realms. Taran and Gurgi investigate Morda's abode, followed by Fflewddur, but all are captured by his snares. After explaining himself (history, boasts, plans), Morda turns Fflewddur and Gurgi into a hare and a mouse, but fails to transform Taran. Something protects him, and he guesses from the stump of Morda's little finger that it is the polished bone. Although elderly, Morda is stronger than Taran, but his strength finally snaps the bone in desperate fury to regain it. (Morda has worn a silver crescent moon with pendant jewel on a necklace. Eilonwy has one without the jewel, and Morda prompted by Taran's recognition of the symbol of the House of Llyr has revealed the primary source of his magic. After Eilonwy was kidnapped as a child, the long search by her mother Angharad ended here, where she weakly sought shelter. Morda inherited both the amulet she wore and the empty book among her possessions. He mastered the amulet and developed its power, gave the book to a pest Glew. (The Castle of Llyr.) Morda's death restores Doli and others to their natural forms. Before parting, Taran gives the jewel from Angharad's amulet to him (returning a gift by the Fair Folk to the House of Llyr) and Doli identifies the ceremonial horn Taran wears in token of Eilonwy's pledge. It will summon the Fair Folk to his assistance, and one summons remains. Taran, Gurgi, and Fflewddur camp next with the ruffian Dorath and his band. Their hosts suspect a quest for treasure and offer guidance to Llunet, in exchange for a share. The guests try to slip away early next morning but Dorath prevents that and extracts a wager on hand-to-hand combat with Taran. He cheats and takes Taran's sword (the stake), then departs. An old shepherd Craddoc, with decrepit holdings, welcomes the companions next. From Taran's account of the mission, he welcomes Taran as his son. Fflewddur departs but Taran and Gurgi remain and labor beside him. Taran and Craddoc develop some bond, but Taran also resents the end of his dream of noble birth. During the next winter, however, Craddoc suffers a bad fall down a mountain gorge, and Taran is unable to rescue him. Near death he reveals that he knew enough of Dallben's history to pose as father and gain Taran as a son. The gorge and the weather threaten Taran too, and he finally summons the Fair Folk who are able to save only himself and Gurgi. Afterward Taran and Gurgi continue eastward, across Little Avren to the Free Commots. They stay first with lucky Llonio and his family on the banks of the river, where Taran learns that life is a net to gather what comes. Next Taran assists and learns the trades of three great craftmasters: Hevydd the smith, Dwyvach the weaver, and Annlaw the potter. They teach him that life is a forge, a loom, and a potter's wheel. He learns enough that he would be welcome to remain as assistance, but pottery alone seems to call him and he realizes to his dismay that he will never master it. He does have a new sword, new cloak, and new bowl. Driving the wares of Annlaw to Commot Ivar, he leads the poor farming village in resistance to a raid by Dorath, killing half the band at no loss of life. Annlaw tells Taran the way to the Mirror of Llunet; he knows it, but has never visited, for he knows who he is. After a short journey, Taran and Gurgi find the Mirror, a pool of water at the mouth of a cave beyond the Lake of Llunet. Taran gazes into it, and he is astonished, but Dorath interrupts, now alone. Evidently there is no treasure, so Taran and the ruffian are soon at swordpoint. His old sword shatters on his new one and Dorath flees. Taran does not pursue but returns to Annlaw Clay-Shaper. He relates that the Mirror showed his own reflection and nothing more. Cheated by Orddu? No, for he saw what he had become and all he had learned on the way.","['taran', 'gurgi', 'return', 'caer', 'dallben', 'follow', 'event', 'third', 'chronicle', 'castle', 'llyr', 'full', 'springtime',

7,The Sweet Far Thing,fantasy," The prologue begins with two men who are searching a river in London (three years before the events of the book) for dead bodies to fence any jewelry or money left upon them. They come across the body of a girl wearing the same crescent moon amulet as Gemma’s. At Spence academy Gemma struggles to open the realms. Pressure builds on her as her friends plot to use her magic to alter the courses of their lives, such as Ann trying to counteract her plainess with the magic in hopes of seducing Tom or joining the theatre. But after much struggling Gemma finds a backdoor-like entry into the realms. By touching a mysterious stone unearthed during the reconstruction of the east wing of Spence Gemma can enter the realms. There Gemma, Felicity, and Ann find Pippa among a group of girls she claims to have saved from entering the Winterlands. Pippa leads the group of girls and attempts to teach them manners in a similar fashion that she was taught at Spence, even though Pippa obviously didn't pick many of these up herself. Pippa asks Gemma to help her cross the river in the realms into the afterlife, but finds that she cannot because she has become a creature of the realms. Pippa asks Gemma to give her some magic and feeling guilty, she does. After a three month absence, Kartik finds Gemma at Spence Academy to tell her that their destinies should not cross again. Gemma angrily stomps off, trying to appear aloof. A later meeting at a boat dock in London crushes Gemma's hope that they could be together. Kartik enlists as a sailor for the HMS Orlando to escape from Gemma and the Rakshana. He refuses to reveal to Gemma the details of his business with the Rakshana or what he will do beyond being a sailor. Despite his coldness, Gemma continues to long for his touch. While waiting for his boat to come in, Kartik lives with the gypsies and helps Gemma arrange a meeting with the Rakshana. The topic of the meeting was her brother Tom, whom the Rakshana was trying to enlist in the club. The meeting was cut short by Mr. Fowlson, a loyal Rakshana member, who unsuccessfully tried to capture Kartik and Gemma. The cost for their safe escape was Mr. Fowlson's discovery that Gemma did indeed have the magic, unlike what she had said to him previously. This incidents ends with Kartik and Gemma leaving the docks after a kiss. At the peak of her tolerance, Gemma finally gave in to her visions and tried to follow the clues left by a mysterious girl in a lavender dress. This leads her to an illusionist who informs Gemma that this girl lived at Spence during her mother's time there. On a whim, Gemma and her troupe of girls venture into the Winterlands to find The Tree of All Souls. When they find it, they all place their hands upon its bark and see different 'visions'- their dreams coming true before their eyes. Gemma alone had a talk with Eugenia Spence who informed her more of the girl in the lavender dress. She also learns that the girl had in possession a dagger which posed a threat to the Winterland creatures. With their affection for each other growing, Kartik finally asks Gemma if she can take him into the realms to see his brother. Once there, they go to into the Cave of Sighs where they make love in each other's dreams. Gemma then offers Kartik a bit of her magic and he uses it simply to kiss her. Afterwards, Kartik finds his brother and is upset by what has become of him, he leaves the realms without the peace he'd hoped to find. Felicity and Ann grow angry with Gemma when she refuses to bring them into the Realms, but since Gemma has broken the seal between the two worlds they soon discover they no longer need her and they cross over by themselves. Gemma panics for her friends are unaware of the war that is breaking out amongst the creatures and, fearing for their safety, follows them into the Realms. She finds them visiting Pippa, whose power has grown but whose sanity is very quickly waning. Pippa attempts to kill Gemma when she refuses to believe that she is 'the chosen one'. Felicity attempts to stop her but Pippa pushes her away in her rage, Felicity is taken aback. When Pippa sees what she's done to her friend she apologizes and asks Felicity to stay with her forever, offering her berries that would doom Felicity into a half-life in the realms. The true relationship between the two is revealed when they share a kiss, but Felicity ultimately refuses the berries and leaves in tears. Time begins to run out for Gemma as creatures of the Realms' patience wears thin. With the seal broken between the two worlds, the creatures run loose, crossing back and forth between the Realms and reality. They attempt to capture Gemma while she is at Spence in order to sacrifice her to the Tree of All Souls. Gemma and her troupe (Kartik, Fowlson, Ms. McCleethy, Ann, and Felicity) quickly cross over into the Realms while the war is raging between the creatures. They are waylaid by Pippa, who sacrifices Ms. McCleethy in Pippa's castle in the Borderlands. Soon after, the castle collapses with Pippa inside. The group of girls following Pippa join Gemma's group to fight the Winterlands. They make their way to the tree where Gemma is stabbed by Amar. Kartik quickly offers himself to the Tree of All Souls in order to save Gemma and they share one last kiss before he is absorbed into the Tree. Gemma then gives her magic back to the land, recreating the barrier between the two worlds, and returns home, heartbroken.

8,Mistborn: The Final Empire,fantasy," In Luthadel, the capital city of the Final Empire, Vin, a scrawny street urchin, is recruited by a thieving group led by Kelsier, the Survivor of the pits of Hathsin, a place where atium, the most valuable metal in the world, is mined. He has a plan to steal the rumored atium stash from the Lord Ruler’s treasury and to free the oppressed Skaa in the process. When Vin learns that she is a Mistborn – a powerful Allomancer who can burn metals to gain special abilities (just like Kelsier) she becomes part of this scheme. Kelsier's thieving crew has other members: there are Misting – Ham, a Thug who can burn pewter, Breeze, a Soother who can burn brass, Clubs, a Smoker who burns Copper and Spook, a Tineye burning tin – and Dockson who has no special abilities but is a great administrator. Together they start working on a plan to overthrow the regime established by the evil Lord Ruler a thousand years ago. Marsh, Kelsier’s brother, infiltrates the Steel Ministry and Vin acts as Valette, cousin of Lord Renoux, to spy out what the nobility is doing. Vin falls in love with Elend Venture, the son of Lord Venture, an heir to House Venture. Kelsier manages to start a House War by assassinating powerful nobles, and Dockson, Ham and Breeze manage to recruit some seven thousand soldiers with which to attack the Luthadel garrison. However, Yeden, the man who originally hired the crew for the job, makes a foolish move leaving the army exposed and majority of it gets slaughtered. The rest covertly moves to Luthadel. House Renoux, the front for getting weapons, is compromised and Lord Renoux with his servants is to be executed. Kelsier and some of the remaining soldiers fight to save them, managing to free most of them. Kelsier is killed in the process, taking a Steel Inquisitor with him. Lord Renoux, who turns out to be a Kandra, a creature capable of changing its body-shape, consumes Kelsier’s body and is able to appear as an apparition to the Skaa. The whole population of Luthadel rises and defeats the garrison and the remaining noble houses. Meanwhile, Vin, armed with the eleventh metal, malatium, goes to the imperial palace, Kredik Shaw, to kill the Lord Ruler. She is captured by Kar, a brutal Steel Inquisitor and left in a cell to be tortured. Sazed, her faithful Terrisman servant, comes to her rescue. Being a Feruchemist, he manages to break his chains by strength stored in a piece of metal in his stomach, and then helps Vin to recover her possessions and a vial of metals. Vin attacks the Lord Ruler and Marsh, thought to be dead by the crew, rushes to aid her as a Steel Inquisitor.

9,The Sorcerer's Ship,fantasy," A man named Gene finds himself cast into a new world by a powerful godlike being. Gene has been changed in such a way that he has every talent needed to survive this new world, including the ability to understand the language of its inhabitants. Gene is rescued from the seemingly endless oceans of this new world by a passing ship that is similar to the looks of a Viking galley. Aboard the ship he makes himself useful as best he can while meeting new friends and enemies. Eventually they come to an island where a mysterious creature who some see as a friend, and some see as an enemy, joins them aboard their ship to help deal with the threat of war from their neighboring kingdom known as Koph. The creature, utilizing his sorcerer-like abilities is employed by the other country known as Nanich to help aid them in the war, but will the sorcerer, and his magic be enough to save the land of Nanich from being overrun by Koph?","['man', 'name', 'gene', 'find', 'cast', 'new', 'world', 'powerful', 'godlike', 'gene', 'change', 'way', 'every', 'talent', 'need', 'survive', 'new', 'world', 'include', 'ability', 'understand', 'language', 'inhabitant', 'gene', 'rescue', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'ocean', 'new', 'world', 'pass', 'ship', 'similar', 'look', 'viking', 'galley', 'aboard', 'ship', 'make', 'useful', 'best', 'meet', 'new', 'friend', 'enemy', 'eventually', 'come', 'island', 'mysterious', 'creature', 'see', 'friend', 'see', 'enemy', 'join', 'aboard', 'ship', 'help', 'deal', 'threat', 'war', 'neighbor', 'kingdom', 'know', 'koph', 'creature', 'utilize', 'ability', 'employ', 'country', 'know', 'nanich', 'help', 'aid', 'war', 'sorcerer', 'magic', 'enough', 'save', 'land', 'nanich', 'overrun', 'koph']"
